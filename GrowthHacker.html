	<h1>Growth Hacker</h1>
	<p>Growth hackers are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the traditional question of "How do I get customers for my product"? and answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email deliverability, and Open Graph. While driven by data and moving metrics, Growth Hackers are also creative problem solvers.</p>
