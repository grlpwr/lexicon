	<h1 class="h1_content">Front-end Developer</h1>
	<p class="p_content">A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which run natively in a web browser or act as compilation input for non-web browser environments (e.g.PhoneGap or Tidesdk). Using these tools, front-end developers work closely with designers or user experience analysts to bring mockups, or wireframes, from development to delivery. Strong front-end developers can also accurately identify specific issues in user experience and provide recommendations and codified solutions to influence the design. It's not uncommon for employers to mix front-end job titles with words which denote the need for crossover disciplinary skills from other practices such as visual design, interaction design, or back-end development</p>
