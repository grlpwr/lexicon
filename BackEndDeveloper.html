	<h1 class="h1_content">Back-end Developer</h1>
	<p class="p_content">Back-end developers use languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user in front-end code. They create or contribute to web applications with clean, portable, well-documented code. But before writing that code, they need to collaborate with business stakeholders to understand their particular needs, then translate those into technical requirements and come up with the most effective and efficient solution for architecting the technology.
