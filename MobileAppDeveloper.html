	<p class="p_content">As the job title suggests, as a Mobile Application Developer, you’re responsible for creating programs used on mobile devices such as smart phones. Your job is to write the program that makes it work. After writing the program, you test it, make the necessary changes and tweaks, and eventually release it to the public. Inevitably, problems with the program will be found, and you’ll then be responsible for repairing them.</p>
